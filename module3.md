# Module 3: Interacting Sprites

Module 3 from the UCL ScratchMaths resources is titled *Interacting Sprites*.
The focus of the ScratchMaths Module 3 is the use of interactions between multiple Sprites in Scratch. These interactions are achieved by using three **computational concepts** - *Parallelism*, *Events* and *Conditionals* - which will be introduced in this Moduleâ€™s activities. As mentioned in the Module 3 Teacher Materials, the Interacting Sprites activities could also be linked to other key learning areas. For example, in Investigation 4 you will have the opportunity to create an interactive story in Scratch, which could be linked to lessons and concepts within the English syllabus.

The activities in this Module also build on computational and mathematical concepts from Module 1, such as: *Sequences*, *Loops*, *Operators* and *Geometry*.

During the workshop, you will complete the following investigations from Module 3:

- Investigation 1: Animating Sprites
- Investigation 2: Encountering Conditions
- Investigation 3: Broadcasting Messages
- Investigation 4: Interactive Stories

We will refer to the following files for these activities:
