# ScratchMaths Workshop

## About

In this workshop you will learn about the ScratchMaths resources and how they can be used for integrating *coding* and *computational thinking* in Stage 3 Mathematics lessons.
You will also collaborate with other teachers in lesson and unit planning with our support.
The team has also created a Scope and Sequence that shows the outcomes from the Mathematics Syllabuses and Digital Technologies content that each of the six ScratchMaths modules address, which can be [downloaded as a PDF file here](files/scope_and_sequence.pdf){: target="_blank" }.

This workshop has been developed in a partnership with [Google](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/){:target="_blank"} and the activites have been adapted from the University of College London's (UCL) [ScratchMaths curriculum materials](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/projects/ucl-scratchmaths/ucl-scratchmaths-curriculum){: target="_blank" }.
